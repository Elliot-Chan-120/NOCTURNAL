Key Modifications Made:
- Integrated with NOCTURNAL's ML training pipelines and drug optimization algorithm "MutaGen" -> specialized to output chemical space network graphs for the optimized and optima compounds that are produced with MutaGen
- Modularized codeblocks into classes and function toolsets to:
	a) generate calculated data (Tanimoto similarity, MCS)
	b) visualize the chemical space network
- Edge weight for constructing the CSN graph can be changed between Tanimoto similarity, MCS, or a hybrid method combining both, where the bias towards one can be set in the config file -> 'tanimoto_bias' (default = 0.5)
- Replaced matplotlib with Plotly for interactive visualization
- Implemented adaptive 2D molecular image sizing
- Adaptive network density to subset size
- Graph cosmetic customizability from config file
- Various error handling blocks
